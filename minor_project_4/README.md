This project demonstrates how to use **Random Forest models** for predicting outcomes.  

- **Random Forest Classifier**: Predicts categories, like whether someone will develop a disease or not.  
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Predicts continuous numbers, like house prices or sales figures.  

The workflow includes:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data patterns and relationships before modeling.  
- **Data preprocessing**: Converting categories into numbers and scaling features.  
- **Model training and evaluation**: Checking how well the models perform.  
- **Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV**: Finding the best model settings automatically.  
- **Feature importance**: Identifying which factors are most influential in predictions.
